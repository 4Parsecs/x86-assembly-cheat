# # RDRAND

    # True random number generator!

    # This Intel engineer says its based on quantum effects:
    # http://stackoverflow.com/a/18004959/895245

    # Generated some polemic when kernel devs wanted to use it as part of `/dev/random`,
    # because it could be used as a cryptographic backdoor by Intel since it is a black box.

    # rdrand sets the carry flag when data is ready; one must loop if
    # the carry flag isn't set, but unlike in this example, one should
    # bound the number of attempts.
